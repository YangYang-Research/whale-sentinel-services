## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Ratings and Response Times

We use the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 4.0** to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities. Below are our response and resolution timelines based on severity:

| Severity   | CVSS Score Range | Time to Fix       |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| None       | 0.0              | N/A               |
| Low        | 0.1 - 3.9        | Within 6 months   |
| Medium     | 4.0 - 6.9        | Within 3 months   |
| High       | 7.0 - 8.9        | Within 1 week     |
| Critical   | 9.0 - 10.0       | Within 3 days     |

### Vulnerability Disclosure
- **Public Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities will be disclosed publicly only after they have been resolved and verified. We will credit the reporter (if desired) and provide details of the fix.
- **Embargo Period**: For critical vulnerabilities, we may request an embargo period to ensure all users have sufficient time to apply patches before public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

To help us maintain a secure environment, we encourage the following:
- Regularly update and patch all systems and dependencies.
- Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
- Monitor and log access to sensitive systems and data.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
